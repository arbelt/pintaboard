Pintaboard is a plugin for [[http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/][Pentadactyl]] that replaces the build-in
bookmarking storage with service to Pinboard.in.


* Installation

  From [[http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/plugins][the pentadactyl plugin page]]: 

: Install these plugins by copying them to the  ~/.pentadactyl/plugins/ directory
: (or %USERPROFILE%\pentadactyl\plugins on Windows).

* Setup

  The setup is simple at this point. First, install the plugin as
  instructed above.  Next, you will need to provide your pinboard.in
  API token as a setting.

  This API token can be found on your settings/password page.  For
  more, see [[http://blog.pinboard.in/2012/07/api_authentication_tokens/][this blog post]].

  In your settings file, simply put:

: set pintaboardToken="<YourTokenHere>"

* Usage

  By default, it overrides the 'a' command for bookmarking. That means
  you can use it as you normally would with Pentadactyl bookmarking.
